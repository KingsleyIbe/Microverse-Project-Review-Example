Students should be able to practice what they have learnt in the study guide about how to review codes for other coders.
The Student are expected to give concised yet detailed professional comments. To be able to do this, the student (code review) should check code against the following standards; if the coder:
- Applied best practices in HTML code.
- Used semantic HTML tags.
- Used CSS selectors correctly.
- Used CSS box model.

On this project, I am performing a code review for myself on a past project.
